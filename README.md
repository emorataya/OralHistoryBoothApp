# Oral History Booth App
Professor Kimberly Laing (klaing@harding.edu) from the History Department has commissioned us to create a prototype UWP app for Harding's 100th Anniversary.  The app will run on a Win10 computer with a keyboard, monitor, and mouse.

The project  consist of two different apps: a recording app, and an admin app.

Recording app:
After agreeing to acknowledgement, user can record a story, not longer than 10 minutes. User can pause or stop recording, re-record, or delete recording. Visual indicator tells how much time remains. App retrieves user's name, student attendance, decade of recording. Recording is saved to mp3 file along with all metadata (name, student, decade, tags).

Admin app:
Admin user can login and view all recorded files, can change password, and logout. Five minute timeout logs user out automatically.

# Contributions of each teammate:
