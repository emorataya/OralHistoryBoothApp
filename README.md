# OralHistoryBoothApp
Professor Kimberly Laing (klaing@harding.edu) from the History Department has commissioned us to create a prototype UWP app for Harding's 100th Anniversary.  The app will run on a Win10 computer with a keyboard, monitor, and mouse.  The computer will be located inside an old wooden phone booth pictured below.
